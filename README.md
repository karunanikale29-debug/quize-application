As part of my frontend development internship, I was assigned to build a Quiz Application using JavaScript that allows users to answer questions and receive instant feedback. The main objective of this task was to understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create an interactive and user-friendly web application. This project helped me strengthen my fundamentals of frontend development and improve my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

The quiz application is designed as a single-page web app where questions are loaded dynamically using JavaScript. The structure of the application is created using HTML, which defines the layout of the quiz, including the quiz container, question area, answer buttons, feedback message, next button, and the final score section. The HTML file acts as the backbone of the project and ensures that all necessary elements are available for JavaScript to manipulate.

CSS is used to style the application and make it visually appealing. The user interface is kept clean and simple with proper spacing, alignment, and color usage. Buttons are styled to improve usability, and different colors are used to indicate correct and incorrect answers. For example, when a user selects the correct answer, it is highlighted in green, and if the answer is wrong, it is highlighted in red. This visual feedback improves user experience and makes the quiz more engaging.

The core functionality of the application is implemented using JavaScript. All quiz questions are stored in an array of objects, where each object contains the question, multiple options, and the correct answer index. This approach allows the application to load questions dynamically instead of hardcoding them into the HTML. JavaScript controls the quiz flow, such as displaying questions, handling user input, checking answers, updating the score, and moving to the next question.

When a user selects an option, JavaScript immediately checks whether the selected answer is correct or not. Instant feedback is shown below the options, and the selected button changes color accordingly. To prevent multiple selections for the same question, logic is added to allow only one answer per question. This ensures fair scoring and smooth quiz flow.

The application also includes a scoring system that tracks the number of correct answers. After the user completes all the questions, the quiz section is hidden, and a result section is displayed showing the final score. A restart button is provided so that users can retake the quiz without refreshing the page. This improves usability and demonstrates dynamic content handling using JavaScript.

This project helped me understand important frontend concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and dynamic content rendering. It also improved my understanding of how real-world web applications provide instant feedback and manage user interaction efficiently.

Overall, this quiz application is a polished and interactive frontend project that meets the internship requirements. It demonstrates my ability to build a complete JavaScript-based application with dynamic question loading, instant feedback, and scoring functionality. This task significantly enhanced my confidence in frontend development and prepared me for more advanced projects in the future.
